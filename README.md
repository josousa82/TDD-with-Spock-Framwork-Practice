Java Testing with Spock teaches you how to use Spock for a wide range of testing use cases in Java. You?ll start with a quick overview of Spock and work through writing unit tests using the Groovy language. You?ll discover best practices for test design as you learn to write mocks, implement integration tests, use Spock's built-in BDD testing tools, and do functional web testing using Geb.
